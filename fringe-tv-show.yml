_(Fringe, Episode 2)_

It's weird when what sounds like the literal pitch for a show is then regurgitated as dialogue within the second episode.

J.J. Abrams' (J.J. - can I call you J.J.? Mr J.J.? The Big Double-J.?) new show comes across as a mix of [X-Files][3] (the [opening credit sequence][4] is practically a homage) and [Alias][2] (female intelligence agent caught up in some complex, unfolding network of intrigue). The stylish location shots are another 'homage', this time to David Fincher's [opening titles for Panic Room][1]:

I dunno; they say "great artists steal", but this strikes me as lazy, even when he's stealing from himself (he's also responsible for [Alias][2]). And I haven't even got to the plot yet.
