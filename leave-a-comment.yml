I am torn about commenting on the web. Part of the reason I wrote this site is because I felt that there should be a single place, a single identity that drew together all of 'me' on the web, and I wanted to explore software that helped support that.

With that in mind, I've pretty-much stopped commenting on other blogs; I have a place where I can make my opinion known - here - and so that's where my opinions should live.

I'm not the only person with this idea:

It's so easy to start a blog that if you want to respond to something I've said here, do just that and link back. I'll figure out some practical way of indicating that you have soon, I hope.
