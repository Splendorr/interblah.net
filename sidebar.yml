Hi
--

I'm James Adam, a freelance software developer in the UK. I'm <a href="mailto:james@lazyatom.com?subject=Cool Project">available for hire</a>, and you can find out more about me here, or at [lazyatom.com](http://lazyatom.com).

This site is powered by {l vanilla-rb}, a software experiment of mine. I think it's pretty neat.

{links}

This is the sidebar. It's actually loaded from the {link_to sidebar} snip, incredibly. There's nothing much here at the moment, but that's more a lack of my own imagination. 

Try viewing <a href="/sidebar.raw">the source</a> of it though.
