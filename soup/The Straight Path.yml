Straying from the path
======================

Let's imagine you're trying to lose weight. 

You have heard great things about the 'Straight Path' diet, and it's intuitively sensible. The diet sets out a fairly strict meal plan, eating different foods than you would normally choose, and with a strange number of meals per day; obviously it's going to take some effort to follow, but is relatively simple once you get into the swing of things.

(Lets be clear right now that this is just an analogy (actually, it's a meta-analogy, but don't worry about that yet), and this diet doesn't exist. Stick with me.)

At the point where you decide you like the sound of the 'Straight Path' diet, you've got two choices:

  1. Abandon your existing habits and strictly follow the 'Straight Path' meal plan, or
  2. Try and incrementally modify your existing habits, sometimes incorporating concepts you read about in the 'Straight Path' plan and trying to get ever closer to that ideal.



Choose your own adventure
---------------

Option 1 sounds like a pain in the ass, right? And option 2 seems much more sensible. 

After all, it's much easier to make small changes than huge ones; much easier to convince yourself to _maybe eat one less slice of pizza than last week_, or swap _just one_ of those _snickers_ for a _granola bar_, than to suddenly give up all your normal preferences and hit the tofu six times a day, right? 

Option 2 is intuitively more sensible.

And don't forget that this is reality, and you don't live like a monk. You have parties to go to, dinners with friends, and so you're going to have to be *pragmatic* about it. There are going to be times when it's just impossible to stick to the 'Straight Path' meal plan; times where the only food around is fast food, and you need to eat. 

So any kind of *absolutism* about following your diet isn't useful - worse, it's counter productive, alienating yourself from your friends and fellow party goers with this talk of a diet that they don't understand or care about.

No, better to go for Option 2.


The straight path
----------------

If the diet was the meta-analogy, here's the actual underlying one.

You have a goal, and there's a clear, straight-line path which you are confident aims you square at that goal. You are currently in the wide swamp that runs alongside the path.

You have two choices:

  1. Get onto that path as soon as you can, and then ardently stay on the path, each step in the same direction
  2. Try to keep an eye on the path, but still move forwards through the swamp, trying to slowly get closer to it.

My thesis is that the only sensible choice is Option 1.

Option 2 is harder; each step brings a choice - expend effort trying to move closer to the ideal, or be [pragmatic][] and scramble foward a little bit, hopefully not moving too much further away from the path.
