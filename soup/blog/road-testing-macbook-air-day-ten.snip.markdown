Day Ten
-------

... yep, we skipped ahead.

I decided to return the MacBook Air. Let me explain why.

Firstly, it's (almost) nothing to do with the Air's suitability as a development machine. For the time I had the Air, I used it almost exclusively and could only fault it when comparing directly with other clearly-more-powerful machines. Day to day, it was a great little machine.

The reason why I decided to return it was because I realised that the weight saving of the Air versus the Pro was actually negligible when you take into account the raw weight of the [Boris Bike][]. Basically, it didn't really make it significantly easier to cycling around.

So instead, I've bought a 27" iMac, and I leave my laptop at home. Ain't no lighter laptop than *no* laptop.

### Summary

So there we have it. I really love the 11" Air, and when it comes to replacing my actual laptop, I will give that form factor serious consideration. If you need a new laptop now, I highly recommend it unless you definitely need continuous, intense computational power, or you think it's going to somehow make a [Boris Bike][] magically lighter.
