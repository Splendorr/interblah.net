Day Three
-------

Today was the first day I carried the Air into work without the bigger laptop (which is living the office for the duration of this test period). It certainly felt good not to have the nagging pain in my shoulders after a few minutes walking with it slung lazily over one.

Walking around with the Air is great - as you might expect - because I can hardly feel that it's there. The 15" isn't exactly back-breaking, but once you've carried it through London's transport system, you are very aware that you are encumbered.

Performance-wise I'm still generally happy working on the Air, and while I switch between it and my older-but-faster laptop, I don't find the slow-down enough to really cramp my style at the moment.
