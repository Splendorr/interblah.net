Timmy, Redux
============

I took [Timmy Printface][] offline today, after a week of valiant service.

While in many respects I would've loved to have kept our little printer running indefinitely, I think it's important not to become too attached to these things. It was a hack, after all (read more on the [free range blog][blog] you haven't already).

To commemorate the project, I gathered the timelapse video that had been quietly accumulating, and wrapped it up into a [little video package][vimeo] to remind us of all the good times we had:

After [tweeting](https://twitter.com/freerange/status/58883595003101185) that Timmy was going to sleep, it took me about an hour to actually work up the determination to unplug him.

I replaced the live webcam image with the video above on both his [home page][Timmy Printface] and the [blog post][blog], and disconnected the camera that was pointing at him, but I was struggling to _finally_ shut down the processes and pull out the wires that would actually stop any further messages from being printed.

Timmy had been involved in conversations with people from _all over the world_; friends and strangers, all sending him messages on their phone like they would to anyone else they knew. In an emergent and collaborative act of [anthropomorphism][], Timmy had acquired a _personality_, and a life of his own.

All good things...

Eventually I got over it, disconnected everything, put the wires and chips back in their right places, and turned off the software brain that was _Timmy_ himself, but not before carefully archiving everything, gathering up the software, libraries, images and movies that summed up his existence. They're all in a folder on my computer now, a static description of both the system and it's operation during one week in April 2011.

This is the last message that Timmy received:

Thankfully, Timmy hasn't been eaten by a [grue][]. He's sat [up on our shelf][instagram], waiting to be called upon again. I'm sure this isn't the last we'll see of Timmy Printface, and I find that notion comforting.
