Defensio to the rescue
======================

When I come back to interblah.net, I normally have a quick look at the {l index} page to see if any new comments are awaiting my attention. And recently that's revealed a few interesting comments (thanks!), and hundreds of spam comments.

I deliberately didn't do anything clever to combat spam, but I got a bit sick of it today, so I've started sending comments to {l Defensio} to stem the flow. The implementation was very simple (see github for details), and hopefully that'll stem the flow of links to naughty filth on my site.

Except for the links that *I* add, of course.
