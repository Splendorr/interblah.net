:title: Why I am an Atheist

There's been a bit of debate on twitter around some dude I'm very vaguely connected to who felt that he could finally out himself as an atheist. Skipping over the idea that anyone should feel wary of disclosing what they believe, this has prompted me to try and explain my own thoughts.

I was brought up as a Christian (a Mormon, in fact), but I stopped going to church at some point around being 16 or 17 I think. I can't actually remember exactly when it was, although I can remember the actual moment where my mother came to try and rouse me and I said that

This is why I'm an atheist: I cannot subscribe to any philosophy which forbids the revision of its own fundamental axioms.
