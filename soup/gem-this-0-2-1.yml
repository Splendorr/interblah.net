Gem This, now a Gem Command
====================

With the latest release of my vanity gem creation tool, I've made it a tiny bit simpler to turn an existing project into a gem, by valthropomorphosizing {l gem-this} into a gem command. BEHOLD:

{code shell,command}

Note the lack of hyphen! That's right, it's as if {l gem-this} was built directly into rubygems itself. Take that!
