How Interblah Works
===================

[Murray][] asked for an overview of how this site is put together, and here I am obliging.

From the server perspective, this site runs on a VPS, under Apache and Passenger. [interblah.net][] is an Apache virtual server; here's the config:

{code apache,virtual-server-conf}

The Alias directive is something I'll probably lose, now that `public` is a proper directory in a {l vanilla} application, but exists to support URLs from older incarnations of the site; likewise for the Redirects, which handle old Mephisto URLs.

Passenger is configured to use [Ruby Enterprise Edition][REE], since I have a bunch of other sites on the VPS and want to conserve memory.

The contents of `/var/www/apps/interblah.net` are available on [github][interblah source]; this is the site directory that Passenger runs.

Here you can see the `config.ru` that boots the application; this `require`s vanilla, which is the [vanilla 0.9.10 gem][gem]. Previous incarnations of my site ran directly off the [vanilla source][vanilla], which was useful for tweaking the system, but made it much more complex to deploy. By making the {l vanilla} code external, the site contents itself can be packaged into source control and deployed directly.

The {l vanilla} gem depends on a few other gems, all of which will be installed automatically when installing the vanilla gem:

* [soup 0.9.9][soup-gem]
* Redcloth & Bluecloth (although I want to start using some of the faster markdown processors)
* Treetop (I'm dynamically loading the snip reference parser, although technically that's not required)
* ratom (used to generate the site feed in the `kind` dynasnip, and required libxml itself)

The most important of these is the {l soup} gem. When the appliation starts, the application instantiates a 'soup', based on a subdirectory of the site code ([here is interblah's](http://github.com/lazyatom/interblah.net/tree/master/soup/)). That directory is defined by default in the site's config.yml:

{code yaml,config-yml}

This file isn't present in the [interblah.net site on github][interblah source] because it contains some sensitive information, like the real cookie secret, and an MD5 hash of my password. However, if your repository is private, you can happily include this file.

The `config.ru` pushs a local `lib` path at the start of the `$LOAD_PATH`, which is intended for dumping site-specific code, although I haven't used this yet. The `public` directory is also a part of the site, for custom images and CSS and whatnot. Finally, the `tmp` directory needs to be there for Passenger to work. You'll see in the [interblah source][] that the `lib` and `tmp` directories are missing; this is just because git won't store empty directories.

I have a few other gems installed for various dynasnips that I've written specifically for [interblah.net][]

* syntax (used by the [code](http://github.com/lazyatom/interblah.net/blob/master/soup/code.yml) dynasnips)
* defensio (was used by the comments dynasnips, until I instigated by policy {l on-commenting})

Hmm - this is a bit rambly, so here is...

Summary
-------

* Apache with Passenger & REE
* Vanilla 0.9.10 installed as a system gem
  * dependencies include Soup 0.9.9
* Site exists as a [git repository][interblah source]
  * I now edit locally, using `rackup` to preview the site on my machine
  * I typically edit using a text editor, although you can use the web interface locally
  * I commit and push up to [github][interblah source]
* To deploy, I just check out this repository on the server
  * I have a local and server-based [config.yml](http://github.com/lazyatom/vanilla-rb/blob/master/config.example.yml)
  * I have a post-update hook on github that triggers a [git pull](http://interblah.net/update-soup.raw)
  * It shouldn't be too hard to deploy using capistrano/thor
