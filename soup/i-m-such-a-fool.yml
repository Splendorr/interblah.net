I'm Such a Fool
===============

I forgot to mention that [I'll be speaking][3] at the upcoming [Ruby Fools][1] conferences in [Copenhagen][1] and [Oslo][2]. 

That's right, a double whammy of my Ruby presentation nonsense. The [title of the presentation][8] is the same as the presentation I gave at RailsConf in Portland last year, but I assure that the content won't be the same. There are only so many times you can flash huge projections of ruby lightning and torrents of blood-red rain before the authorities become involved, you know?

As an aside, it's kind of hilarious that they let you (by you I mean me) write your (my) own bio for these conference things. I mean, how seriously can you take someone who's biography centres around Acts As Hasselhoff? That said, they did strip the link to it from the text, so at least *someone* is trying to protect the public...

Anyway - RubyFools! Copenhagen on April 1st and 2nd, then Oslo on April 3rd and 4th. Mighty Matz will be there, along with a whole bunch of other Ruby types, none of which I'm sure need introductions from the likes of me. It's going to be my first time in the [birthplace of Rails][4], but I've no doubt that it's going to be fun.

Are you going? Anything you'd like me to [spout about][7] in particular? Any [kitsch][5] [celebrities][6] you'd like me to target? Let me know - otherwise, you've only yourselves to [blame][9]... :)

See you there!
