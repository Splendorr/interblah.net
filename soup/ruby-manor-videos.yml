Ruby Manor Videos
=================

Just a quick note - some of the videos for [Ruby Manor][1] are [now available][2]. I've been doing the editing myself, so please forgive any weirdnesses and lack of finesse! While I'm sure confreaks could've done a slightly more polished job, I hope the spirit of our conference (as affordable as possible) justifies itself adequately.
