Hello, I'm James Adam, and you've found my blog.

I am a software developer working as part of [FreeRange](http://gofreerange.com) here in the UK. If you're looking for a group of top-notch creative people, [get in touch](http://gofreerange.com).

Or, if you're interested in my stream-of-consciousness jibber-jabber, click around here.

You can also find information about me at [lazyatom.com](http://lazyatom.com).

This site is powered by {l vanilla-rb}, a software experiment of mine. I think it's pretty neat.

This is the footer. It's actually loaded from the {link_to footer} snip, incredibly. Try viewing <a href="/footer.raw">the source</a> of it to get an idea of how vanilla works.
