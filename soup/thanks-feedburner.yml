Thanks, Feedburner
============

This is my feedburner subscriber list, over time:

<div style="padding: 10px; background-color: white; margin-bottom: 1em; text-align: center;"><img src="http://interblah.net/assets/2008/3/27/Picture_2.png"></div>

So apparently the feed for interblah.net hasn't been working for a while. I spent an hour or so poking around the guts of Mephisto this morning, and it should be working again.

What I don't get is why Feedburner didn't alert me to the sudden disappearance of the feed (it was returning a 500 error). Surely this would be a useful service? There are no "FeedMedic" reports in my account, so I can only presume that they didn't notice.

Weird.

Anyway, service resumes as normal! In case you missed any of the more recent posts, I've been talking about [Vanilla.rb][1], [Speaking at RubyFools][2], and that fact that [shared hosting isn't evil][3].

(<strike>There's something still broken regarding the comments, alas. Perhaps that will motivate me to finish [Vanilla.rb][1]!</strike>)

(Update: comments fixed. Probably. But I'm still going to finish [Vanilla][1].)
