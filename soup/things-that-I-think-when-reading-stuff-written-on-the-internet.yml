Whenever I read certain phrases, I seem to have reasonably consistent reactions to them. I'm cataloguing them here.

"The guys at" (i.e. "The guys at twitter", "The 37signals guys", etc) always highlights the surplus of males, particularly in software development. I'm not saying that it isn't true, but for some reason I do wish that people would stop using this particular turn of phrase. On a related note, I find it particularly amusing when someone says "The engines guys", given that I am the only real developer involved in that project. Anyway.

Tweets starting with "Hey, ", or "So, ", as if we were just hanging out, and they thought of something to say. Let me make it clear: I am not hanging out with you people on twitter.

Sentences that start with "my friend <x>", which basically means you are bragging about who you are friends with.

Any kind of earnestness or statement of intent or values - this is the internet, of course what you are writing is bullshit. Even if the person writing it is me! Huzzah.--- # Soup attributes
