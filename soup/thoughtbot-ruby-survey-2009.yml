Thoughtbot Ruby Survey 2009
===========================

I wasn't hugely into the [Thoughtbot 2006 Survey][survey], because (and as they noted), the questions were very poorly constructed:

> There are questions that are too narrow or too broad. There are questions that are missing options. There are questions that assume too much about an “either/or” scenario, when people really behave differently depending on context. There are questions which insult people’s core beliefs, I guess. Fortunately for all of us, the results of this survey aren’t being used to decide anything too important.

However, I'm still not sure they get it:
  
> Maybe most encouragingly, when asked about whether the types of questions in the survey mattered or were a huge waste of time, nearly 90% chose the “I think it’s worth caring about your craft, and these questions are professionally relevant” option.

Here are the choices people were given in the survey:
  
1. I think it's worth caring about your craft, and these questions are professionally relevant.
2. This is a huge waste of time, you guys are a bunch of psychos, just get back to coding.
3. It sure is, and I'm not capable of or willing to work on a team with anyone who disagrees with my correct answers.
  
Obviously people want to agree with

> I think it's worth caring about your craft

but in doing so, we are also saddled with agreement to

> these questions are professionally relevant

The fact that [lots of people did choose answer one][wrapup results] unfortunately doesn't support whether or not the questions were a "huge waste of time" or not. Any to be fair, even if the questions _are_ relevant, the available answers were not. This means that any data derived from this survey is fundamentally worthless. It's a shame, really, but that's the truth of it.

I'm not taking this seriously - it would be crazy to, naturally, and clearly it's been composed with humour and good intentions. That said I can't help feeling it's a bad omen. Despite it's lack of rigor, we are presented with some conclusions - for example:

> A solid 75% of people always use parentheses on method definition — maybe enough to justify criticizing people who don’t?

There is value in consistency, and this does apply to a community's behaviours as well as those of a team, or indeed of an individual, but __consistency is only secondary to consideration__. Blindly criticising behaviour because it doesn't match a poorly-derived norm feels sufficiently similar to our earlier readiness to [declare things as evil without much research or understanding][evil] to make me take notice. 

The most important sentence in this whole thing is

> the results of this survey aren’t being used to decide anything too important.

Lets make sure that's true. Trying to define best practices using only the results of the [Thoughtbot 2009 Survey][survey] would be a sad step back in the direction of [cargo-culting][].

If the Ruby community is trying to more clearly define itself and reach an adulthood of sorts, perhaps we should stop paying attention to these [effectively-meaningless _yes-me-too_ manifestos][rmm] and start actually changing the way real people experience our work.
