class HelloWorld
  # although the name doesn't need to match the snip name,
  # it's simple to follow that convention where appropriate

  def handle(name=nil)
    if name
      "Hey #{name} - Hello World!"
    else
      "Hello World!"
    end
  end

  # note that this code must evaluate to a class. One way of achieving that is by 
  # putting 'self' at the end of the class definition.
  self
end
# Another way is by referring to the class at the end of the content. Either works fine.
