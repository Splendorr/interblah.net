Typekit and Legibility
======================

I got into a conversation about [Typekit][] on Twitter the other day, and [Paul Battley][paul] hinted that he [didn't really see the point][paul tweet]:

Typekit doesn't seem to work on Chrome-based browsers, or Mobile Safari (so that means the iPhone, and probably Android). That's a shame, but I expect that Typekit will address the issue, if only for the desktop-bound browsers, but Paul's comment about _legibility_ got me thinking.

I suspect what Paul thinks is important is getting to the meat of a site - the actual information - without any unnecessary hinderances. It's a goal I can fully support.

It's Web 2.0, right?

Good websites let you consume their data in any way you like. This one has an [atom feed][], but you can also slurpt the HTML and do what you like with that. All of the content is available {l typekit-and-legibility, individually} (or just the [text](/typekit-and-legibility.text), or even the [raw snip](/typekit-and-legibility.raw)), and the full posts are in the feed, so you're genuinely able to consume this site in any way you please. However, if you actually visit directly in a browser, I have an opportunity to add an extra dimension to that experience, aesthetically. That's what Typekit assists with.

It's certainly easy to produce a difficult-to-read version of this content using [Typekit][], and I may have achieved just that here. I think the point is that this is my domain (in both senses of the word), and it's employed as a medium for expressing myself, both intellectually and visually.
