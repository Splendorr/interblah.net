Weeknotes - 1669
================

It was my birthday this weekend, so I didn't get much time to write anything up, but here goes:

* Our office space fell through, but we have some other options that we're following up;
* We're starting to look more earnestly into proper co-operative legal structures
* The weather has been far too nice to be working so much!

That's all for now. I'm going try and write up 1670 as the week goes, so that I don't end up with such a crappy post next time.
