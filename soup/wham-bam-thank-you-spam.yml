Wham, Bam, Thank You Spam!
==========================

My ultra-secure commenting system has finally fallen foul of the malicious robots of spammers. They're probably terrorists, hijacking the precious interblah.net-page-rank fluids to build some kind of *net-bomb*. Unthinkable!

Anyway, this is good for me, because it forces me to develop some new stuff to counter the spam. And the first step is being able to delete snips. Here's my quick-n-dirty {link_to dynasnip} for the moment:

{show-dynasnip delete}

I've also added the link to the template, but this in turn raises some interesting, unanswered questions about how to take Vanilla.rb from an interesting toy into a proper web platform.
