Another FreeAgent Widget Update
==============

There's been a bit of a delay fixing this issue, but you can grab the [latest FreeAgent Widget from github][download].

[![FreeAgent Timesheets Widget][widgetimage]][download]

If anyone's interested, it was because the widget didn't take FreeAgent's (relatively) new `/verify` mechanism for getting your User ID. It does now.

As a bit of an explanation for the delay, at {fr} we don't really track our time anymore and so we're not really using the Timesheets aspect of [FreeAgent][] anymore (although we use [pretty much every other part][FreeAgent]; it's a a great application). 

The beauty of open source, however, is that any of your are free to [fork the project on github][github] and make any changes you like.

(P.S. yeah, I know, that [weeknote burst](/weeknotes-1665) didn't really last, did it.)
