Blog posts I will never finish
==============================

As part of my {l looking-ahead-at-2013, "clearing of the decks for the new year"}, I'm declaring bankruptcy on the never-to-be-finished drafts that I've had cluttering up my repository for all of 2012.

Cry out in loss, reader, as you will never learn about *The Kintama Problem*, where I was trying to simultaneously explore/explain to myself why I have written my own test framework (the eponymous {l kintama}), and also talk a bit about {l setup-vs-action-for-ruby-tests,the structure of tests}, ideas for {l rerunning-tests-in-ruby,"how to (re)run tests"} and {l capturing-behaviour-in-ruby-dsls,common decision-points every Ruby DSL designer shares}.[^lies]

Gnash your teeth in despair as you realise that you cannot struggle through my clumsy conflation of thoughts about {l bret-victor}'s excellent {l inventing-on-principle}, and how it might possibly relate to why I reject the alpha-geek programmer stance that mastering the {l vi} editor is good[^more-lies].

Climb through blizzard storms up to the highest pinnacle only to throw yourself off, such that you might escape the terrible knowledge that my post-conference thoughts about {l ru3y-manor}[^agenda] are forever lost to you!

Woe! Woe be upon us all!

[^lies]: Actually, I lied -- you can read about {l kintama} and also {l setup-vs-action-for-ruby-tests}, {l rerunning-tests-in-ruby} and {l capturing-behaviour-in-ruby-dsls}.
[^more-lies]: I lied again -- you can read about {l inventing-on-principle} and {l vi} if you like.
[^agenda]: AKA my attempt to ham-fistedly force my philosophical agenda once more down the throats of the conference-going nerd. Alas, this is a blog post that I have *actually* abandoned, rather than decomposed like all the others.
