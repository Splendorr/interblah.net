FreeAgent Widget Update
===============

(another update: please grab [FreeAgent Widget 1.3.5 here][download].)

[![FreeAgent Timesheets Widget][widgetimage]][github]

The most notable new feature is that it will preserve unposted time across restarts (or crashes), so if you restart while working, you won't lose track of how long you've been working for. Honestly, this has bitten me so many times.

See the [original announcement][] for more details, and the source is always available on [github][]. As before, if you have any problems, get in touch via [github issues][issues].

Also please note that you'll need API access turned on; for more details see the [recent post on FreeAgent Central][api].
