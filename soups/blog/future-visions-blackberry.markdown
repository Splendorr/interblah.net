Behold, as the Phone Administrator graciously installs a bunch of corporate shit on *your* phone! Marvel as they upgrade your security level to "Level 5"! Bow in humble gratitude as they authorise the installation of an app! Sigh in relief as they remotely brick the phone you lost!

In a Blackberry future, you can't do anything -- not even find your own desk -- without your phone, and the Phone Adminstrator will be the benevolent, silver-haired gatekeeper to your phone-dependent life.

Well... great.
