Leaving Reevoo
==============

There's an interesting mixture of sadness and excitement whenever you leave a job, but I'm particularly feeling it as I prepare to move on from my current employer [Reevoo][]. I've had the privilege of working with a solid team of truly excellent people: 

 * [James Mead][], the mastermind behind [Mocha][]; 
 * [Chris Roos][], liberator of [local information][chris-code]; 
 * [Paul Battley][], liberator of [BBC programming][iplayer-dl]; 
 * [Luke Redpath][], who is already busting out [iPhone apps][iSqueeze]; 
 * [Ben Sales][] and Craig Smith, bouldering supremos;
 * [Tom Lea][], [Joel Gluth][], [Louis Garman][] and [Matt House][], all equally awesome in their own ways.

... in black and white, as well in real life, an impressive collection of smart developers and engineers. Which made my decision all the more difficult, although I take solace in knowing that it won't be the last time I get the chance to work with these people - the [Ruby community in London][LRUG] isn't too huge, after all!

Onwards and upwards
-------------------

So what's next? Good question. I don't have another cosy full-time job to drop into, because I've decided to take the leap into self-employment. That's right - I'm going free range. Am I crazy, what with all the financial doom and gloom going around these days? Maybe. But - there's no time like the present. 

[Ruby Manor][] has sold out, and we're looking forward to seeing if our conference experiment has worked. After that we're almost at Christmas, and then the shiny face of 2009 will smile upon us. 2009 - we really are living in the future, aren't we.

In the not-too-distant future I'll have more to say about what I'm going to do next, but for the moment I'd just like to say that it's been an excellent experience working at [Reevoo][], and when I say 'Au Revoir' to my friends on Webber Street in mid December, I'll be wishing them all the best in the future.
