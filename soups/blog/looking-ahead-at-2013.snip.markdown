Looking ahead at 2013
=====================

To ring in the new year, I've been poking and tinkering with this site in the hope that I will actually get back into blogging.

While I really like the flexibility that {l vanilla} affords me, it comes at the expense of having to develop a lot of my own tooling, and some of that results in a larger *energy hump* the be overcome when I want to post.

2013 is almost certainly going to be a year of relatively big choices. There's a reasonable chance that I'll be spending less time in London. I also think it's the year that either {gfr} really hits its stride in terms of balancing client work, product exploration and individual exploration... or that it transforms into a slightly different kind of organisation.

My shtick is, as ever, that I want any choices to be handled proactively. My gut feeling is that the longer we wait to make choices, the less control over the outcomes we end up having. I strongly prefer to tackle things head-on once we they are identified, rather than waiting until a decision *needs* to be made.

This isn't to say that I want to change or control *everything*; rather, knowing when a choice exists lets me identify the decisions that don't really matter, and focus on the decisions that are *most important*.

If we wait too long, the decision makes itself, and we are simply along for the ride as the consequences play out around us. I do not want a [life lived by default][default]. If I'm going to work for myself, then it seems crazy not to try and do something *exciting*. I accept that this means it will also probably be *hard*.
