Road Testing The 11" MacBook Air
================================

__TL;DR__ - some indulgent waffle about whether or not the 11" MacBook Air is a usable development machine. The conclusion will almost certainly be: it depends, but probably.

I've started trying to cycle home from work recently, and I've found that my trusty 15" MacBook Pro can often make this a bit awkward. While there's certainly a valid argument that I should just suck it up and get fitter, I am lucky enough to be in a position where I can at least _consider_ resolving this by replacing my current laptop with a lighter breed.

This is actually one of several options that I've identified:

1. Get a lighter laptop, along with a larger external display for the office, choosing between
  1. an [11" MacBook Air][]
  2. a [13" MacBook Air][]
  3. a [13" MacBook Pro][]
2. Get an iMac for work, and don't travel with my laptop
3. Do nothing, get fitter, climb the highest mountain and punch the sky

I've spent a few months umming and ahhing, but having bored everyone I know with my deliberation, I've finally decided to take an 11" MacBook Air for a two-week test run. Will it's diminutive size bother me? Will it's slower processor (1.6 GHz Core 2 Duo vs. the 2.8GHz processor in my already-outdated MacBook Pro) frustrate me? Here's what I am finding.
