As you might be aware, I've been involved in the running of a couple of {link_to ruby-manor, "Ruby conferences"} over the past few years.

While {link_to ruby-manor, "Ruby Manor"} is by no means *my* thing - it's very much owned by the community - as one of the original instigators I had a few rough goals that I wanted to achieve. In a nutshell, I wanted to demonstrate that it is possible to run a conference which is equal to any of the "big" confs in terms of technical quality, usefulness and general atmosphere, but without the bloat which has become a typical part of the conference experience.

I'm talking about fluffy inspiration from "big name" (i.e. same every year) keynote speakers without any real insight. I'm talking about low quality food and swag that we've all inadvertently paid for in our ticket prices. I'm talking about cheaper tickets to boot - can it really cost hundreds of pounds per person to run these events?

So that's what we did in 2008, and again in 2009.

Some time later...
----------------

Hereafter I can only speak for myself. I know that a lot of people enjoyed the conferences we ran, and the praise is something I personally treasure. However, after the euphoria of the first event, and then the hard work of the repeat, I was left thinking about my original goals again. 

We had imagined that, with a little bit of structure, the community would come together to suggest, plan an refine the presentations and structure of the day, but it was becoming clear that it still required a significant injection of energy from the "organisers" to keep the process going. While a not-insubstantial portion of the attendees did participate in shaping the proposals, the majority of people engaged in a minimal way ("yes, that sounds interesting") or not at all. This left me wondering about some of these goals.

I can only make a handful of hypotheses about why participation felt so weak.

### Hypothesis A: Confusion

My optimistic hypothesis is that people we not sure or confident about how they could engage with the process. Admittedly, it was rather free-form (a mailing-list), and so there was no apparent structure unless you read the introductory posts and some of the content to get your bearings.

We chose email because - well, everyone uses it. We hoped it would be the simplest way both for us to get something rolling, and for people to start engaging with it.

### Hypothesis B: Laziness

My pessimistic hypothesis is that people are generally lazy, and so it was easier to allow or assume that other people would propose something, or give feedback, than it was to do so personally. I suspect now that a lot of people enjoy going to conferences partially *because* they can just rock up having bought a ticket and have everything choice made for them, and get the same conference "buzz".

These people are happy to buy a ticket, but for whatever reason don't really bother directly contributing to the event.

### Hypothesis C: The Quo is fine

Perhaps people don't really care about the presentation content, or the food, and are only going to be a part of the mild hysteria that sets in when you're on a tech jolly away from home? They clearly they don't mind spending the money, as most established Ruby conferences continue to sell out, often before they've even outlined the presentations. I think that's pretty strong evidence that people either:

* don't care about the talk content
* are happy to delegate the nature and quality of the content entirely
* some mixture of the two.

So if people don't care about the price of the ticket, and they don't really mind about the exact nature of the content, what is the point of running Ruby Manor in the way we do? Does it serve *any* purpose beyond being another event that people can snatch up tickets for?


What next?
----------

In reality I think there's a bit of truth in both hypotheses. But either way, the question I am personally asking myself now is this: what is the purpose of Ruby Manor?

I had originally hoped it would be as a concrete statement to potential attendees and existing conference organised that we didn't need their t-shirts, their lunch boxes, or the same speakers peddling the same presentations from conference to conference. I had hoped it would be a catalyst encouraging people to actively question why other conferences charged hundreds of pounds, and at the very least that they should declare whether or not a conference was for-profit, and if not then make the finances transparent. I hope hoped that conference attendees would demand a stronger influence on the conferences themselves.

But now I'm not sure if that's what people really care about. Ruby Manor was nearly instantly sidelined as a "unconference", a label which can too easily deployed by "real" conferences to protect the status quo. Personally I think that unconferences are *better* at achieving the fundamental goals of a conference than these other ones are - meeting people, getting new ideas. Unconferences strongly encourage participation.
