The Postal Inter.net Office is shutting down
============================================

Two years ago, as a joke and a nod to [making things fast][], I took a silly
domain name and served a few silly "HTTP" requests using the UK postal service
as the transport layer. It was called [Postal Inter.net](/postal-internet).

It was good fun, and I really enjoyed some of the requests that we received,
but the "server" has not been accessed for more than a year now, so I think it's
time to put it to rest.

You were fun, *postalinter.net*, but your time has passed. I release you into
the quantum foam.
