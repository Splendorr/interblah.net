The Postal Inter.net Office is shutting down
============================================

Two years ago, as a joke and a nod to [making things fast][], I took a silly
domain name and served a few silly "HTTP" requests using the UK postal service
as the transport layer. It was called [Postal Inter.net](/postal-internet).

It was good fun, and I really enjoyed some of the requests that we received,
but the "server" has not been accessed for more than a year now, so I think it's
time to put it to rest.

You were fun, *postalinter.net*, but your time has passed. I release you into
the quantum foam.

Here are a few of the requests that we go. Obviously you are only seeing one
side of the communication; the responses are now lost in the ether (or in
the post boxes of the UK).

The most impressive request thoroughly embraced the nature of TCP/IP, and
arrived in a number of packets, out of order and with some data corruption (see
the missing data on the envelopes), which we had to reconstitute into the actual
request within our 'server'. Bravo, [Tom Stuart](http://codon.com)!

Tom was challenged for login details, and here was his response.

Alas, I cannot remember what was at [http://experthuman.com/proof](http://experthuman.com/proof), and whatever was there is gone now. Perhaps that's for the best.
