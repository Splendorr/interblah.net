Apparently {l ticketgate, all that drama} around ticket pricing put me off blogging for six months. Ah well. Here's the quiet conclusion to that tale, and then we're done.

Since I'm probably not even going to be in the country when [Scottish Ruby Conference](http://scottishrubyconference.com) is happening, I sold the tickets that I'd bought to some of the people who didn't manage to get any before they sold out.

I sold the tickets for the approximate "average" ticket price - i.e. my estimate of what the tickets would've cost if they'd all been priced evenly but still brought in the same overall revenue.

I've just donated the difference to the [Children's Hospice Association Scotland](http://www.chas.org.uk/), which is the charity that SRC has supported via its charity day workshops.

And with that, I'm putting the final nail in the coffin of this conversation. I am now silent on the issue. It is a tale [told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing](http://shakespeare.mit.edu/macbeth/macbeth.5.5.html#21). Enjoy your t-shirts and swag!

I don't think I was very successful in communicating my point (which I won't re-iterate here), and I don't think I'm going to be able to illuminate you by writing (and certainly not by tweeting!), so I'll just continue to make my point via the concrete conference implementation that is {l ruby-manor, Ruby Manor}, and we'll leave it at that.
