Weeknotes 1805
==============

Ha! Remember {l weeknotes-1669, "weeknotes"}? Hilarious.

Anyway, I wanted to keep writing, and this seems like the best structure for doing so. Also, I couldn't think of a snappy title for what's been happening this week. By my reckoning, last week was Week 1805. Apparently I started the count at the week I was born; that seems a bit silly in retrospect, but it's all arbitrary in the end.

Last week I spent a lot of time getting various things in order, including this site. I broke up a bunch of draft posts that had been cluttering up my `git st` for probably more than a year, and psuedo-published them. They're still not exactly finished, but at least they are *something*.


## Manor Fo[u]rth

We are achingly close to being able to announce the date and venue for {l ruby-manor, Ruby Manor 4}, at which point we can also start selling tickets and begin the {l vestibule}-powered CFP process. We also need to write some stuff about how the CFP is going to work, particularly in the light of all the recent minority involvement discussion.


## Yee-haw

Meanwhile, I'm in Austin for a few weeks, planning my personal geographic *strategy* for the next year. However that works out, I predict a significant increase in frequent flier miles.

I have a pay-as-you-go SIM via AT&T for use when I'm in the USA, but recently they've changed their plans such that the only way to get data if you have a smartphone is to pay, like, $25 a month. There's no other way to get PAYG data if you have a smartphone. That's a big pain in the ass when you're trying to get some information from a tweet while wandering around near 6th Street.


## Navel gazing

I haven't done any real programming in 2013 yet. Instead, I've been writing a bit more about what my hopes and plans for {gfr} are for 2013 and beyond, as have the others, and we'll be discussing our output on Tuesday. The idea is that we'll use this material as the raw material from which to distil and refine our company direction -- our *strategy* -- for the next year.

I've been thinking a lot of about our company dynamic and direction, and I think it's fair to say that I've been the most vocal about these things internally, but it's still a challenge to hone my thoughts and intuitions into useful fodder. Who knows, maybe I think too much about it; I don't think so though. I'm just keen to **actually get things done**.

So, we'll talk about that on Tuesday morning (my afternoon) and see what transpires. Video into the office hasn't been working very well for anyone, which seems to point the finger of connectivity blame pretty squarely at the office DSL; something else to sort out, but the pain is only experienced by those not in the best position to actually do anything about it...
