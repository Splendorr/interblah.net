Ru3y Manor Redux
================

Another year, another attempt to ham-fistedly force my philosophical agenda once more down the throats of the conference-going nerd.

After a year in the wilderness, super-entanglement from the minds of [Murray][] and [Tom][] flipped Ruby Manor into existence from the quantum foam. I think we decided around April that we were going to give it another go. I was skeptical, to be honest. Well, you of all people, Dear Reader, will know that. You've read {l my thoughts, ruby-manor-thoughts}. You know me better than I know myself!
