Inventing on Principle
=======

{l bret-victor}'s talk {l inventing-on-principle} gave me quite a bit to think about. Here's the talk, if you want to watch it now:

There are lots of great demonstrations and though-provoking ideas in the talk, but it inspired two personal insights that I want to get down here before their luminosity dims.

The first is that it helped me understand why I am not a big fan of the {l vi} editor, despite all of its apparent efficiency gains. I've written {l vi,a bit more about that here}.

The second is about another intuition I have about the future of programming. Most programming at the moment involves producing a static description of software (in text files), which is then "run" (possibly after "compilation").

I suspect that this form of expression isn't infinitely sustainable, and I'm interested in styles of programming where the developer is dealing with a system that is *always* running, and where modifications to that live system feel more like gardening or sculpting -- software *husbandry*, if you will -- than emitting hard, static declarations of behaviour.

Smalltalk is, as I understand it, a bit like this, because all objects are "live" and modified while the system is running. I'd like to spend more time becoming familiar with systems like Smalltalk so I can better explore this intuition that I have.

The common thread that Bret's presentation highlighted for me is that a lot of the skill in programming (both in terms of writing the software, and using the editor to write the software in the case of {l vi}) involves humans *playing computer*, and I'd very interested in ways to move beyond that.

A quote from the talk:

> You essentially have to **play computer** -- you have to simulate in your head what each line of code would do on a computer.
>
> And to a large extent the people that we consider to be skilled software engineers are just those people that are really good at playing computer.

That. Exactly that.
