I assume you're James Adam, the main guy behind Rails Engines. 

If not, sorry. 

But if so, I've been developing on Rails for about a year and half. What Engines seeks to do seems like a painfully obvious need for anybody who has developed > 1 websites. That Rails 2.0 didn't even touch the issue behind Engines strikes me as hubris. 

But the thing that troubles me about Engines is that there doesn't seem to be a site providing examples of plugins developed on Engines (a la your old discarded login_engine). That would suggest that Engines has failed as a broad based solution, and has lived on only in hidden dev-shop caves and obscure dev group mail lists. Bummer if so. 

But it just seems that if Engines was such a bad idea, I could Google for a persuasive argument against it. But I can't. Or, alternatively if Engines was as useful as it seems, I could Google for a thriving open community of Engines developers. But I can't. 

There seems to be a strange anomaly in the universe here. My guess: banal human failings. (Sorry for digressing on your quiet blog.)--- # Soup attributes
