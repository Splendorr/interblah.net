Vanilla
=======

A long time ago (like... 2002 or something; the *iron age* of the internet) I powered my blawg (then at [lazyatom.com][1] using an application called [Vanilla][2], developed by [Christian Langreiter][5]. To see what it was like, here's a cringeworthy [flashback][3] to my site back then; or, better still, look at [Murray Steele's site][6] which runs on Vanilla at the moment. As does [Christian's][5], naturally.

Vanilla is written in [Rebol][4].
